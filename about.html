            <h1>Software Engineer in Training (and Future Tech Trail wizard)</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Gisubizo Gisele</strong> – but feel free to call me Gisele! I'm a software engineering student with a passion for technology and innovation. Currently, I'm studying at AUCA, and I'm excited to apply the skills I'm learning to real-world projects.</p>
<br>
            <p>I was born and raised in Kigali, Rwanda, and I strongly believe that technology is for everyone, regardless of gender. As I dive deeper into coding, I’m constantly inspired by the potential to create software that can make life easier, more efficient, and more connected.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Though I'm still building my experience, I'm always eager to learn new things, collaborate with others, and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology. My journey is just beginning, but I'm committed to growing every day and creating solutions that make an impact.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I'm not working on my projects, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends in tech, solving challenges, and exploring how technology can make a positive difference in the world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Let's connect – I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations!</p>
